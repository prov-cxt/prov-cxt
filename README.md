# PROV-CXT

This repository establishes the first public disclosure of **PROV-CXT**, a
research concept proposing an extension to the W3C PROV family of models
for representing context provenance in LLM-driven and context-dependent
computational workflows.

The purpose of this repository is solely to create a timestamped,
publicly accessible record of the idea’s existence and authorship.
No implementation, model, or full specification is included at this
stage.

**Original conception:** 2024-03  
**Public disclosure (this repository):** 2025-12-01

Further materials, drafts, or technical details may be added in future
commits as the research progresses. This repository serves as the
canonical public anchor for the PROV-CXT concept.
